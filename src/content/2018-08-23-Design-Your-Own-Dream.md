Existing jewellery is frequently the inspiration for new custom creations. When a customer sees a piece of jewellery they like, but they prefer it with a different stone shape, size or colors, it happens all the time. Frequently, our clients want a product that is a little thinner, longer, or taller, or prefer a different texture or pattern than what is currently available. We're frequently tasked with coming up with solutions to make identical jewellery for less money.
We're Jewelry Designs, so no worries there! We'll personalize it to your specifications!


Unless the finishing are flawless, you've probably discovered the perfect design.
Changing the sort of stone or the precious metal used may be all that is required to suit your preferences.

We've done a lot of work on replicating family treasures for our customers.
Occasionally, a second piece of jewellery is created for a different member of the family.
You'll also have to replace any worn-out or missing beloved jewellery pieces.
Most jewellery products can be redesigned or replicated by our team of designers for you as long as recreating the item does not violate trademark or patent rights.
If the stones or materials of a family heirloom carry sentimental importance, you may choose to repair the original jewellery.
If this is the case, you may opt to have the item restored.
A professional designer will look for the safest repair procedure while keeping faithful to the original materials and style.
